## Projects
### Camphor Tree
_July – September 2022_  
[https://github.com/lzbrooks/Camphor_Tree](https://github.com/lzbrooks/Camphor_Tree)

I constructed a system using a pair of flask servers to transmit email between a RockBLOCK+ and a Raspberry Pi onboard ship.

The system uses an inexpensive waterproof company-facing Iridium satellite modem (RockBLOCK+) intended for IoT relay.  Because the RockBLOCK+ uses Short Burst Data, anything I want to transmit is processed and compressed.

See [repository](https://github.com/lzbrooks/Camphor_Tree) for implementation details.

### CIOutputParser
_January 2016 – February 2020_  
[https://github.com/lzbrooks/ci_output_parser](https://github.com/lzbrooks/ci_output_parser)

Python-based parser I developed for collating and formatting log reports.  CIOutputParser provides my clients with immediate actionable feedback on the quality of their code, tests, prose, and documentation.  The parser generates reports that can be automatically triggered by github checks and subsequently appended to all commits and pull requests.

Handles log files from the following sources:
- Android Lint - structural error checker
- Junit Android Lint - unit test framework
- pre-commit - pre-git-commit-hook framework
- Vale - customizable prose and style checker
- Gtest - Google's C++ testing and mocking framework
- Firebase - mobile device virtual machine matrix lint and test framework
