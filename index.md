## Projects
### Camphor Tree                            July – September 2022
[https://github.com/lzbrooks/Camphor_Tree](https://github.com/lzbrooks/Camphor_Tree)

A pair of flask servers to communicate between a RockBLOCK+ and an email server.

The goal of this project is to receive and send emails while underway across the Pacific out of cellphone signal distance on my sailboat without paying for an InReach.  The system works using an inexpensive company-facing Iridium satellite modem (RockBLOCK+) which was IPV8, extremely low power and low latency.  Because the RockBLOCK+ provided Short Burst Data intended for IoT relay, any data I wanted to transmit needed to processed.

See [repository](https://github.com/lzbrooks/Camphor_Tree) for implementation details.

### CIOutputParser                                   January 2016 – February 2020
[https://github.com/lzbrooks/ci_output_parser](https://github.com/lzbrooks/ci_output_parser)

Python-based parser I developed for collating and formatting log reports.  CIOutputParser provides my clients with immediate actionable feedback on the quality of their code, tests, prose, and documentation.  The parser generates reports that can be automatically triggered by github checks and subsequently appended to all commits and pull requests.

Handles log files from the following sources:
- Android Lint - structural error checker
- Junit Android Lint - unit test framework
- pre-commit - pre-git-commit-hook framework
- Vale - customizable prose and style checker
- Gtest - Google's C++ testing and mocking framework
- Firebase - mobile device virtual machine matrix lint and test framework
